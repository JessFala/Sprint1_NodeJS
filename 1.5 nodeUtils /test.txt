In Spain we say "it's amargura"
In Spain we say "ay, me desangro"
In Spain we say "qué coño hago"
In Spain we say "joder qué largo"
In Spain we call it soledad. 
In Spain we don't know where to go
In Spain our feeling are so strong
Sometimes our hearts look like bombs
Bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs" by Rigoberta Vandini
